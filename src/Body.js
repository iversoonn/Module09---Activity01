        In PDC 20, I look forward to learning about various programming
        paradigms, understanding the intricacies of software development life
        cycles, and gaining practical experience with coding projects. I am
        particularly interested in exploring modern programming languages and
        frameworks, and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.
        The subjectâ€™s focus on developing problem-solving skills and working
        with cutting-edge technologies will be instrumental in enhancing my
        technical abilities and preparing me for future career opportunities in
        the field of Information Technology.
